/**
 * Unified toolbox category for the integrated UNBdev.board.
 *
 * Feature implementations retain their established TypeScript namespaces;
 * blockNamespace metadata routes their blocks here for one student-facing
 * toolbox entry.
 *
 * `subcategories` \u2014 not `groups` \u2014 is what makes this entry expand into
 * per-feature rows. The toolbox builds nested rows only from `subcategories`
 * (webapp/src/toolboxeditor.tsx), and binds a block to a row when the block's
 * `subcategory` attribute matches the row name (webapp/src/blocks.tsx,
 * `filterBlocks`). `groups` renders flat section headers inside a flyout, so
 * the two are not interchangeable.
 *
 * No `more` row: public blocks are deliberately assigned only to their
 * feature subcategory. Marking a public block as `advanced=true` also makes
 * MakeCode consider it for its generic "more" grouping. That would make the
 * feature layout less predictable, so advanced transport helpers stay hidden
 * and student blocks stay in their named rows.
 *
 * `subcategoryIcons` supplies the same recognizable microphone, spinner,
 * Wi-Fi, gears, and microchip cues used by b.Board. It is consumed by the
 * pinned UNB PXT framework's nested-category renderer.
 *
 * `Control` carries the student-facing Click socket blocks ported from
 * Brilliant Labs' bBoard_Control; see UNB-ECE/unblabs-platform#87.
 *
 * It appears between the editor's Extensions and Advanced rows. Its own
 * chevron expands or collapses the named feature rows without affecting the
 * rest of the toolbox.
